## About

``mlFORTH`` is a maximally reduced (free) implementation of the ``metaL`` 
language, especially targets for on-device programming for Android-powered 
devices. It uses [[Marvin Minsky]]'s [[extended frame model]] as a system core 
but does not provide any metaprogramming capabilities of the full-sized metaL 
system. All meta-features available in the ``mlFORTH`` are inherent to the 
core [[homoiconic]] [[executable data structures]] model and are a side effect.

The only single goal of the ``mlFORTH`` creation was the scripting on mobile 
phone using a very compact programming language (short one-liner commands). 
There are no cross-compiling, dynamic .apk building, IoT, distributed 
computing, game design, etc. It is more like a programmable stack calculator 
then script engine (but works with objects to be more comfortable for the user).
